Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
So, take her wrap, fellas
Dolly, never go away again

Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly, never go away
Promise, you'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again";
